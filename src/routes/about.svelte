<h1>About Me</h1>


<p in:fade>I'm Brenden.</p>

<p in:fade>
  I'm a front-end developer based in Southern California.
  <br>
  I have a BBA in Entrepreneurial and Small Business Operations from CSUF, and was an account manager for the largest plumbing wholesaler in the nation for three years.
  <br> While there I discovered a passion for programming, developing tools to improve sales efficiency.
