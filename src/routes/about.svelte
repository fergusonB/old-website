<h1>About Me</h1>

<!--add information on intj  / the other dp or something, maybe something about typing - just stuff that would make me stand out a little
identity is no way tied to these but it should give some more color than a standard interview would provide
-->

<p>I'm Brenden.</p>

<p>
  I've always loved the internet and building things.
  <br>
  I'm currently interested in building web-based programs, scraping, statistics, and machine learning.

</p>

<p>I have a BBA in Entrepreneurial and Small Business Operations from CSUF, and was an account manager for the largest plumbing wholesaler in the nation for three years. While there I developed tools to improve sales efficiency, including logistics tools and sales calculators.</p>
