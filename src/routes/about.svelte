  I've been making simple websites for the last fifteen years for fun.
  <br />
  I got my start with geocities, then worked with Dreamweaver, before finally
  settling on plain HTML with javascript snippets I found on the web.
</p>

<p>
  Last year, I decided to introduce myself to real coding by taking a python
  course to bring more value to my employer and loved it.
  <br />
  I decided to dive in and become a programmer.
  <br />
  I've always loved the internet and building things, so this became the natural
  place to bring my newly forged programming ability.

<h2>What do I like right now?</h2>
<p>
  This website is statically generated with Svelte and Sapper, hosted on GitHub,
  and is protected by Cloudflare.
  <br />
  The entire website including images (at the time of writing) is under 100kB,
  has a perfect Lighthouse score, and also functions as a progressive web app
  (PWA).
  <br />

  My favorite language right now is python. It started this journey and I find
  it incredibly intuitive. Comprehensions make me happy, and python is so easy
  to read.
