<h1>About</h1>

<p>My name is Brenden Ferguson.</p>

<p>
  I've been making simple websites for the last fifteen years for fun.
  <br />
  I got my start with geocities, then worked with Dreamweaver, before finally
  settling on plain HTML with javascript snippets I found on the web.
</p>

<p>
  Last year, I decided to introduce myself to real coding by taking a python
  course to bring more value to my employer and loved it.
  <br />
  I decided to dive in and become a programmer.
  <br />
  I've always loved the internet and building things, so this became the natural
  place to bring my newly forged programming ability.
