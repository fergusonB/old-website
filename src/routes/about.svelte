<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm Brenden.</p>


<p>
  I've been creating websites and tools for 15 years. 
  <br>
  What started as just some simple drag and drop editing on Geocities led me to Dreamweaver, Wordpress, and finally to working with raw HTML and javascript. 
  <br>


</p>

<p>
  I've always loved the internet and building things.
  <br>
  I'm currently interested in building web-based programs, scraping, statistics, and machine learning.
  <br>
  I also like automating things, a lot of my home is being run by a Pi, and I can often be found toying with dirt-cheap debian VPS'
</p>

<p>I have a BBA in Entrepreneurial and Small Business Operations from CSUF, and was an account manager for the largest plumbing wholesaler in the nation for three years. While there I developed tools to improve sales efficiency, including logistics tools and sales calculators.</p>
